# A/B Street Instructions

This is an alpha-quality demo. Please email <dabreegster@gmail.com> or
[file a Github issue](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet/issues/) if you
hit problems.

## Playing the game

- Use the **tutorial** to learn the controls.
- Play the **challenges** for directed gameplay.
- Try out any ideas in the **sandbox**.

## Common issues

If the size of text and panels
[seems very strange](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet/issues/381), you
can try editing `play_abstreet.sh` or `play_abstreet.bat` and passing
`--scale_factor=1` on the command line. This value is detected from your monitor
settings, so if you have a Retina or other HiDPI display, things may be too big
or small.
