# A/B Street

Ever been stuck in traffic on a bus, wondering why is there legal street parking
instead of a dedicated bus lane? A/B Street is a game exploring how small
changes to a city affect the movement of drivers, cyclists, transit users, and
pedestrians. It works anywhere in the world, thanks to
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about).

## Project mission

If you fix some traffic problem while playing A/B Street, my ultimate goal is
for your changes to become a real proposal for adjusting Seattle's
infrastructure. A/B Street is of course a game, using a simplified approach to
traffic modeling, so city governments still have to evaluate proposals using
their existing methods. A/B Street is intended as a conversation starter and
tool to communicate ideas with interactive visualizations.

Why not leave city planning to professionals? People are local experts on the
small slice of the city they interact with daily -- the one left turn lane that
always backs up or a certain set of poorly timed walk signals.

Existing urban planning software is either proprietary or hard to use. A/B
Street strives to be highly accessible, by being a fun, engaging game. See
[here](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/project/motivations.html) for more
guiding principles.
