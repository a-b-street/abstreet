## How it works

## How to run

You'll need `wasm-pack` and `npm` setup. You'll also need the `data/system/` directory to contain some maps.

Quick development: `wasm-pack build --dev --target web && npm start`

To build the WASM in release mode: `wasm-pack build --release --target web && npm start`
