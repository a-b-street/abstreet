//! popdat ("population data") generates `Scenarios` given a map and some external census data.
//! Some of this functionality should maybe be reorganized or incorporated into the importer crate,
//! but for now, it's convenient to organize it here.
//!
//! All of the types and methods here are tied to a single `Map`. Even if a city is chopped up into
//! multiple pieces, for now, let's assume we're just dealing with one map at a time. That lets us
//! use the map's coordinate system, building IDs, etc.
//!
//! These types form a pipeline:
//!
//! 1) For a given map, find some census data that describes how many people live in different
//!    areas of the city. (CensusArea)
//! 2) Take the CensusAreas and turn them into individual CensusPersons, by randomly choosing a
//!    specific building on the map as their home, and assigning specific attributes based on the
//!    census data's distribution.
//! 3) For each CensusPerson, classify them into a PersonType, then generate a Schedule of
//!    different Activities throughout the day.
//! 4) Pick specific buildings to visit to satisfy the Schedule.
