# A/B Street Instructions

This is an alpha-quality demo. Please email <dabreegster@gmail.com> or
[file a Github issue](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/issues/) if you
hit problems.

## Installing the game

Grab a pre-built binary release -- updated every Sunday, announced at
[r/abstreet](http://old.reddit.com/r/abstreet):

- [Windows](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/releases/download/v0.2.9/abstreet_windows_v0_2_9.zip)
  - Unzip the folder, then run `play_abstreet.bat`. You'll probably getting a
    warning about running software from an unknown publisher.
- [Mac](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/releases/download/v0.2.9/abstreet_mac_v0_2_9.zip)
  - Unzip the directory, then run `play_abstreet.sh`.
  - If you get an error about the developer unverified,
    [follow this](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).
    Help needed to start
    [signing the release](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/issues/107)!
  - If that just opens a text file instead of running the game, then instead
    open terminal, `cd` to the directory you just unzipped. Then do:
    `cd game; RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./game 1> ../output.txt 2>&1`
  - [Help needed](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/issues/77) to package
    this as a Mac .app, to make this process simpler
- [Linux](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/releases/download/v0.2.9/abstreet_linux_v0_2_9.zip)
  - Unzip the directory, then run `play_abstreet.sh`.
- [FreeBSD](https://www.freshports.org/games/abstreet/), thanks to
  [Yuri](https://github.com/yurivict)

Or you can [compile from source](/docs/dev.md).
